Data Structures for Linear Algebra
==========================================

Before just diving into the Linear algebra, just lets understand on what is algebra.
Algebra is the mathematical expression with any non numerical values like x, y or z(or any....)

for example : 2x + 10 = 12  [:: now we need to find the value of x with the given expression/equation... lets do it]
              2x = 12 -10   [:: since i have transfer with 10 to other side, sign got changed (here + changed to -)]
              2x = 2
              x = 1
              so the value of x from the above expression is 1. 

Assumptions:
1. The equations which having the exponential forms will be not considered as the Linear equatios 
   for example:
   1. 2x^2 + 23 = 23
   2. 2*(root of 4) + 22 = 23

   from the above two examples.,one has power value and another one has the root value, so those are not consiedered as the linear equations but they consider as the Non-Linear Expressions. 

In simple terms --> "Finding the unknown value with the knows value is called as the linear algebra"
