Data Structures for Linear Algebra
==========================================

Before just diving into the Linear algebra, just lets understand on what is algebra.
Algebra is the mathematical expression with any non numerical values like x, y or z(or any....)

for example : 2x + 10 = 12  [:: now we need to find the value of x with the given expression/equation... lets do it]
              2x = 12 -10   [:: since i have transfer with 10 to other side, sign got changed (here + changed to -)]
              2x = 2
              x = 1
              so the value of x from the above expression is 1. 

Assumptions:
1. The equations which having the exponential forms will be not considered as the Linear equatios 
   for example:
   1. 2x^2 + 23 = 23
   2. 2*(root of 4) + 22 = 23

   from the above two examples.,one has power value and another one has the root value, so those are not consiedered as the linear equations but they consider as the Non-Linear Expressions. 

In simple terms --> "Finding the unknown value with the knows value is called as the linear algebra"

Consider the below Example: 
Take two people one guy is Ramesh who is a theif and another guy whose name is Deepak who is respecful citizen in the city. So one day Ramesh has robbed the bank and started escaping from the bank , since Deepak who is also a responsible citizen with respectful citizen , he started chasing him to get back the money which ramesh has stolen. 
Details: 
 1. Ramesh who is robber has a car which goes 150 km/h 
 2. Deepak who is a responsible citizen has a car which goes 180 km/p but started 5 minutes late from the time when robber has started. 

 solution:
 ==========
 given data: Ramesh car speed 150 kmp which means 2.5 km per minute
             Deepak car speed 180 kmp which means 3 km per minute but started 5 mins late. 

 Assume 'T' is the time when they meet each other (OR Deepak catch the thief)
 so .... Ramesh = 2.5T
         Deepak = 3(T-5) [:: Since he started 5 minutes late]

 Equating the both the expressions 
          2.5T = 3T - 15
          0.5t = 15
          T = 30 mins 

:: Hence, time taken for the Deepak to catch the robber is 30 mins


Tensors:
---------
Now, lets understand what are the tensors in the Machine learning. 
In Simple terms, Tensor is the name given to the container of numbers or values. 
it holds the data like scalar, vector , matrix and 3d matrices which goes further towards to the n-matrices also ....... 

Please refer the below Table 
-----------------------------------------------------------
Concept  |  Type of Data       | Example                  |
-----------------------------------------------------------
Scalar   |  one value          | any single value         |
-----------------------------------------------------------
Vector   | series of values    | an array                 |
-----------------------------------------------------------
Matrix   | 2D Excel sheet      | any square kind of ....  |
-----------------------------------------------------------
3D Matix | a cube of values    | 3d -> 4d --> nD          |
